                <p class="default-text">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small
                    and
                    lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                    connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p class="default-text">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
                    and a core
                    set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul class="indented-text-list">
                    <li class="indented-text-block">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to
                        control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
                        application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form
                        input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li class="indented-text-block">Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        relevant
                        to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                        communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

            <section class = "main-section" id="Javascript_and_Java">
                <header class="side-title title">JavaScript and Java</header>
                <p class="default-text">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
                    The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which
                    was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p class="default-text">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                    supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.
                    The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                    objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
                    properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p class="default-text">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                    variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
                    or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                    are not explicitly typed.</p>

            <section class = "main-section" id="Hello_World!">
                <header class="side-title title">Hello World!</header>
                <p class="default-text">To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello
                    world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <code class="code-blocks">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br>greetMe("World");</code>
                <p class="default-text">Select the code in the pad and hit CTRL + R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

                <header class="side-title title">Variables</header>
                <p class="default-text">You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of
                    variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p class="default-text">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                    subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p class="default-text">You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also
                    use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.</p>

                <header class="title side-title">Declaring Variables</header>
                <p class="default-text">You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p class="default-text">With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code class="code-blocks">var x = 42;</code>
                <p class="default-text">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables</p>
                <p class="default-text">By simply assigning it a value, for example:</p>
                <code class="code-blocks"> x = 42; </code>
                <p class="default-text">This always declares a good variable. It generates a strict JS warning. You should not
                    use this variant</p>
                <p class="default-text">With the keyword let. For example:</p>
                <code class="code-blocks">let y = 13;</code>
                <p class=default-text>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope variable. See variable scope below.</p>
            </section>
            <section class = "main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
                <header class="title side-title">Variable Scope</header>
                <p class="default-text">When you declare a variable outside any function, it is called a global variable,
                    because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                    function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                </p>
                <p class="default-text">JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a
                    variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.
                    For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within
                    which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                <code class="code-blocks">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p class="default-text">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                <code class="code-blocks">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is <br> not defined</code>
